### Analysis and Challenges
#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

###### For Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I added a "Years" and "Date Created Conversion" column to my Kick Starters Challenge sheet. From there I created a pivot table using "Parent Category" and "Years" in the filters, "outcomes" in the columns, "date created conversion" in the rows, and "outcomes" in the values, which became "count of outcomes". From the data in the pivot table, I was able to make a line chart to display the results. 
###### The only issues that were encountered in this deliverable, was making sure I used the categories in the correct areas on the pivot table, which took a couple tries.
